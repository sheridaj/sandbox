Try the Demo Server
===================

Signals comes with a `demo server <http://docs.yaksignals.apiary.io/#>`_ that you can test against just to see how this is all working.

#. Save the sample schema from the demo server docs.
#. ``signals --schema ~/path/to/schema.json --generator ios``
#. TODO: what sort of thing can a user now do automatically?
