What is Signals?
----------------
Signals is a code generation tool to take the grunt work out of communicating between your front-end and back-end applications. Simply describe your server endpoints in a JSON file and watch Signals automatically generate Objective-C data model files. When you update your API, all you have to do to update your front-end code is re-run the script. Signals is an open-source project initially built by the folks at `Yeti <https://yeti.co/>`_.
